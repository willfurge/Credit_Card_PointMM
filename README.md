# Credit Card Point Market Making Bot

## Overview
This project implements a market-making bot that simulates internal credit card point reserving and pricing mechanisms. The bot is designed to model how banks manage point liabilities, offering insights into spreads, reserves, and profitability of consumer rewards programs.

## Features
- Point market-making engine to simulate buy/sell spreads  
- Reserve requirement modeling for outstanding liabilities  
- Monte Carlo simulations for stress testing strategies  
- Configurable parameters for spreads, volatility, and point valuations  
- Data pipeline for simulation inputs and outputs  
- Basic Streamlit dashboard for visualization
